			<b>Computer Networks:</b> Computer networks can very in size from a small network connecting only a few devices to massive networks connecting a vast number of computers together such as at a data centre, university campus, or the largest computer network, the internet.  When connected to a computer network devices can easily share information and data and even access to hardware, such as a network attached printer.

			<b>E-mail:</b> or electronic mail is a unique address consisting of an alpha-numeric username and domain name seperated by the @ symbol.  While specific usernames and domain names do not need to be unique their combination does, in order to seperate multiple users.  For example, Athabasca University has the domain name athabasca.edu people with an email address through Athabasca University use the format of username@athabasca.edu (i.e., jsmith16@athabasca.edu) every address that uses the athabasca.edu domain needs to have a unique username but an address that uses a different domain (i.e., gmail.com) can use the same username as a different domain making jsmith16@athabasca.edu and jsmith16@gmail.com both unique address despite sharing a username.

			<b>Internet:</b> The Internet is the largest example of a computer network.  Any computer connected to the network of an ISP (Internet Service Provider) will typically have constant access to the internet, a vast network of interconnected computers that can share information.  The most common use of the internet is to request Web pages through a domain name, which is a text-based address used to uniquely identify a computer on the Internet.  For massively popular web pages (e.g., Facebook) that computer being accessed is not a typical desktop PC but a powerful server that is closer to a supercomputer than its desktop counterpart in order to provide access to <A HREF="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/"> approximately 1,845,000,000 daily users</A>.

			<b>Operating System:</b> The main system software of a computer.  The operating system is the program that all additional programs are built on top of and cannot run without the operating system.  The operating system is the first piece of software to be loaded into the computers memory when the system boots, or powers on. Microsoft <i>Windows</i> and Apple <i>Mac OS</i> are popular examples of desktop operating systems but there are many more based on the freeware Linux Kernal (commonly called distributions), such as <A HREF="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</A>, <A HREF="https://archlinux.org/">Linux Arch</A>, and <A HREF="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</A>.

			<b>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs):</b> A Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly referred to as its abbreviation, URL, is a protocal that identifies a specific web page. An example of a URL is "<b><i>https://athabascau.ca/programs/summary/bachelor-of-science-in-computing-and-information-systems.html</i></b>". "https://" identifies the <i>Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol</i>, "athabascau.ca" is the domain name of the Web server that specifies the Athabasca University website, "programs" and "summary" identify a specific folder and subfolder respectively where the specific web page is stored and "bachelor-of-science-in-computing-and-information-systems.html" is the document that makes up the web page that the URL is requesting from the web server.
