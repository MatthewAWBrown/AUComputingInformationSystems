		<br><br> With global lockdowns and stay-at-home orders being a staple of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19
		pandemic, restaurants experienced significant impact to their business necessitated by public health precautions.
		However, restaurants were able to continue to operate thanks in no small part to services and <A href="unit1_Terms.html">apps</a> such as
		<b><i>Skip the Dishes</i></b>, <b><i>UberEats</i></b>, and <b><i>Doordash</i></b>.  These applications allow
		customers to use an interactive menu from their mobile device to order from participating restaurants and an
		independent third-party contractor delivers the food from the restaurant to the customer.  The functionality
		of the app allows for customers to browse a restaurants full menu as well as make customization choices to
		the order.  Some restaurant brands have developed their own bespoke apps that allow customers to submit 
		orders through the app and have the order ready for the customer when they go to pick up their order.
